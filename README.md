Library of Congress Colors
=========================

What colors are in images? View color swatches for images in Library of Congress digital collections.

Swatch colors are determined using [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Algorithms). The colors that appear are not necessarily the most frequent colors, but the center of a cluster of color values.

This project uses thumbnail images from Library of Congress digitized collections, accessed via the Loc.gov JSON API.
